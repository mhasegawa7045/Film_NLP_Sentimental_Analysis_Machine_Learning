 Tokenization, Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Network of Bigrams
 
 ## Film Genre and Story Description Machine Learning: Data Mining and Text Mining 


The purpose of this project is to see if text mining techniques can ease better analysis for categorizing movies with just the `Descriptions` while ignoring the `Genre`from the dataset, `IMDB_movies.csv`, which is stored under the dataframe variable, `movies_desc`. 

- Classified movies from raw movie text `Descriptions` without reliance on genre labels by transforming the text into numerical features with **Tokenization and TF-DF**.  
- Identified hidden themes in blockbuster movies by finding topic mixtures for each movie by using **Topic Modeling**.
- **Sentimental Analysis** used Sentimetal Clusters, based on `bing` and `nrc` lexicons, to see how `Sentiment` affects `Rating` and `Revenue`. 
- The **network of bigrams** help summarize how frequented Movie `Description` word-terms create term relationships and how they connect to other movies.
